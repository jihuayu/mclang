#JEI

jei.description.rock=Rocks are found lying on the ground. Breaking them can give you small rocks, with a small chance of giving you an small iron ore piece.
jei.description.grass_fiber=Grass fibers are dropped when breaking tall grass with a knife. They can also be obtained by cutting plant material in your hand with a knife. They are used to make grass string, which is needed to create basic tools
jei.description.stick=Sticks are dropped from leaves. Using any knife doubles the chance of getting a stick.
jei.description.flint_shard=Flint shards can be obtained from knapping flint on any rocky surface. Right click a piece of flint on a stone like block, and it might split into two flint shards. It might take a few tries to get it right though.

jei.description.knife=Knives can be used to cut certain materials. Hold the knife in one hand, and an item in the other, and right click. This will use up 3x the durability on the knife and produce a new item. Knives are also effective at breaking plant material such as leaves.
jei.description.mattock=Mattocks are a combination of an axe, a shovel, and a hoe. They can be used as an axe, with the added benefit of breaking most soft blocks that are broken with a shovel.
jei.description.saw=Saws are multipurpose cutting instruments. They can function as an axe, and also are able to cut wood down into parts by using them as crafting ingredients. They are more effective than a crude axe in this way, giving four planks per log and two sticks per plank
jei.description.firepit=To build a firepit, throw one log, one plant string, and three sticks on the ground. Then right click and hold a firestarter on that block. The items will be consumed and a firepit will be created. You can relight a firepit by clicking on it with a firestarter. You can extinguish a firepit by breaking it or clicking on it with a piece of sand.
jei.description.forge=To create a charcoal forge, place charcoal on the ground by right clicking. The higher the pile, the better. Surround the charcoal pile with four stone type blocks, then light it with either a flint and steel or a fire starter.
jei.description.wood_pile=Wood piles can be created by shift right clicking any log. They function as small storage containers that only store logs. In addition, these log piles can be turned into charcoal. By placing log piles on the ground, and completely covering them on all sides with other log piles or full, non flammable blocks, and then lighting it on fire, they become a charcoal pit, and will eventually turn into charcoal.
jei.description.tuyere=A Tuyere is a small pipe used to funnel air into a charcoal forge. Right click with it on a piece of cobblestone, and it will become a Tuyere block. When a bellows is facing the tuyere, it will pump air into the block, which will heat up adjacent charcoal forges.
jei.description.blast_furnace=The blast furnace is a multiblock structure. Above the blast furnace, in a '+' shape, place stone type blocks, with a charcoal pile in the middle. The more charcoal, the hotter the blast furnace will get. Light the blast furnace with a flint and steel. The blast furnace will also heat up if a bellows is facing into it.
jei.description.clay_tool=The clay tool is used to shape blocks of clay into pottery. Right click on a block of clay to shape it into pottery. As you work, the clay will shape into smaller and smaller pieces, until nothing is left.
